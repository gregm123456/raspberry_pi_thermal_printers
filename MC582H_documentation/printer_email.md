Hello,Greg Merritt

Thank you for purchasing our thermal receipt printer products;

Now I will send you the specifications and instruction sets of these two small ticket printers you purchased, please download them;【Due to the limitation of Amazon page, we can't upload the product manual and instruction set manual, so we can only send the information to our customers by email. Thank you for your understanding\! 】

The instruction sets of the two printers you purchased are universal, MC582H has the function of cutting paper, and the baud rate is **115200;** The voltage supports a wide voltage between **12V\~24V,** but the maximum voltage cannot exceed 24V. Otherwise, it will burn the printer motherboard, which will make it unusable. It is recommended to use 3A for current;

**MC206H** has no paper cutting function, and the power supply is between **5V\~9V**, and the maximum voltage cannot exceed 9V; Otherwise, it will burn out the printer motherboard, which will make it unusable. It is recommended to use 2.5A； for current.

**When Testing or Using These Two Printers, Be Sure To Pay Attention To The Voltage, And Don't Mix Them Op, Otherwise You Will Make Mistakes And Burn Out The Printer Motherboard.**

The printer supports docking platforms such as Android, MCU /Arduino, Linux and Windows. There is a development package for docking Android; Docking MCU can use instruction set printing, and docking Windows system can use USB interface. After installing the printer driver, use the driver to print when printing.

The download link of printer USB interface driver is as follows:

In addition, the printer (MC206H)you bought supports switching between TTL and RS232. In the attachment, there is an operation guide on how to switch between TTL and RS232. Please switch according to actual needs. The printer defaults to TTL interface. If you also use TTL, you can use it without switching.

The printer has an independent red 2PIN power interface, and the USB port and serial port are only used for data transmission and cannot be used as power supply.

On the body of the printer, there is an identification sticker with information such as the model, voltage and baud rate of the current printer. Please use the corresponding power supply according to the power supply version you purchased, and the current is recommended to use 2.5A；

The serial port only needs to connect TX, RX and GND, and the default baud rate is 9600\. The power supply is a red 2Pin interface. On each interface, there is a definition of the corresponding pin.

At the same time, according to the customer's common instructions, we have compiled a print example of the instruction set, which you can refer to.

Thank you for your order,

Best wishes\!

Hello,

We have purchased these two Maikrt thermal printers:

[RS232 Serial Port Printing Module of 58mm Thermal Receipt Printer Supports microcontroller Android Linux Secondary Development USB Embedded Serial Port Printer with Paper Cutting Function](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CBYJ3KSF)

and

[Micro Thermal Printer 5\~9V Embedded Thermal Receipt Printer Serial Port Microcontroller Secondary Development MCU Printing Module TTL/RS232](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YGVPPWV)

We use these printers with Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu Linux. Any supported connection method is ok.

Please, will you share the instruction print examples showing bold, underline, reverse text, variable line spacing...etc print example? Also please share any other general information, instructions, or code examples for these printers to be used with Raspberry Pi Ubuntu Linux.

Thank you very much for your kind support.

Best wishes,

\-Greg Merritt
